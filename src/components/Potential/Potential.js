        A devout Mormon architect finds answers, all the way to WWJD.

      <p>
        As published in Meridian Magazine, Fall 2010, and similar to as
        presented at the 2001 Art, Belief and Meaning Symposium at the Brigham
        Young University, Museum of Art.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the vision of Joseph Smith as described by John Taylor, as
        referred to me by Truman Madsen: “We believe that we shall rear splendid
        edifices, magnificent temples and beautiful cities that shall become the
        pride, praise and glory of the whole earth. We believe that this people
        will excel in literature, in science and the arts and in manufactures.
        In fact, there will be a concentration of wisdom, not only of the
        combined wisdom of the world as it now exists, <span className="bold">but men will be inspired
        in regard to all these matters in a manner and to an extent that they
        never have been before.</span> And we shall have eventually, when the Lord’s
        purposes are carried out, <span className="bold">the most magnificent buildings, the most
        pleasant and beautiful gardens…</span> This is part and parcel of our faith…”
        <a href="#sources">[1]</a>(Emphasis added)
      </p>

      <p>
        This inspired visions tells us that architectural design (as well as
        other arts and sciences) can and will progress “in a manner and to an
        extent that they never have been before.” Imagine the inspiration and
        thought processes that will produce such buildings! If we truly hope to
        see Joseph Smith and John Taylor’s vision realized, we need to be open
        to all the design inspiration available by repeatedly asking “How can
        this be designed better”, perhaps even all the way to “WWJD”.{" "}

      <p className="bold">PREMISE </p>

      <p>
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was restored through the
        young Joseph Smith, Jr. having faith in the promise of James that, “If
        any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men
        liberally…” <a href="#sources">[2]</a> Indeed, the pattern of the glorious restoration was that
        the prophet Joseph, with his gregarious, vigorous, and compliant mind
        caught hold of a thought, intently contemplated its principles, went to
        the Lord to ask regarding it and was then given divine revelation. We
        believe these doctrines were not from the fertile mind of Joseph Smith,
        but of God. Joseph did become increasingly knowledgeable and wise but,
        as some might consider a paradox, this wisdom came through strict,
        joyful, voluntary adoption of thinking of things the way God would.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        President Ezra Taft Benson said, “Men and women who turn their lives
        over to God will find out that he can make a lot more out of their lives
        than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken
        their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply
        their blessings, increase their opportunities…” <a href="#sources">[3]</a> A beloved Primary
        song says it eloquently, “I’m trying to be like Jesus, I’m following in
        his ways, I’m trying to love as he did, In all that I do and say… I try
        to remember the lessons he taught, Then the Holy Spirit enters into my
        thoughts…” <a href="#sources">[4]</a> The scriptures are full of the admonition to receive and
        follow the will of God. “Look unto me in every thought.” <a href="#sources">[5]</a> “…follow me
        and do the things which ye have seen me do.” <a href="#sources">[6]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Temple we learn that Adam was commended for not following the
        philosophy of Man… Rather, he was commended for his integrity to look
        for messengers (messages) from God. The Lord gave this warning, “Oh the
        vainness, and frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are
        learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel
        of God, for they set it aside supposing they know of themselves,
        wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness… But to be learned is good if
        they hearken unto the counsels of God.” <a href="#sources">[7]</a> The process of
        sanctification is to become more and more like God. Elder Bruce R.
        McConkie taught that true worship is emulation.<a href="#sources">[8]</a> One of the most
        profound truths restored in the latter-days is the ultimate potential we
        “heavenly children” have to become one with Jesus and Heavenly Father as
        they are one. <a href="#sources">[9]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        I accept the principle that we have the privilege and subsequent
        responsibility to seek and receive not only guidance from God, but to
        approach things as He would. The questions, “What should I do?” and
        “What would Jesus do?” become synonymous. This principle of Godly
        orientation is fundamental to a happy life.
      </p>

      <p>
        This same principle has application to all facets of life, not just
        spiritual. Brigham Young said, “In the mind of God there is no such
        thing as dividing spiritual from temporal, or temporal from spiritual;
        for they are one in the Lord.” <a href="#sources">[10]</a> Modern revelation defines this
        relationship: “Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me
        are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was
        temporal…” <a href="#sources">[11]</a> President Young taught, “With God, and also with those
        who understand the principles of life and salvation, the Priesthood, the
        oracles of truth and the gifts and callings of God to the children of
        men, there is no difference in spiritual and temporal labors-all are
        one. “Our religion incorporates every act and word of man. No man should
        go to merchandising unless he does it in God; no man should go farming
        or any other business unless he does it in the Lord.” <a href="#sources">[12]</a> “We do not
        allow ourselves to go into a field to plough without taking our religion
        with us; we do not go into an office, behind the counter to deal out
        goods, into a counting house with the books, or anywhere to attend to or
        transact any business without taking our religion with us.” <a href="#sources">[13]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve been taught these concepts all my life. As a natural consequence of
        trying to practice these ideals in my life, they have affected my
        professional design thinking. As an architect, the question always
        before me is, “How can this [site, entry, sequence, roof, trim, finish,
        light, detail, etc.] be designed [better]?” The question is asked;
        answers bring a set of design ideas; then the question is asked of these
        initial schemes; which can then produce even better designs. This
        process can be repeated again and again, until one of the designs is
        finally deemed good enough to be selected. Architects throughout the
        world and throughout history have worked with this question in all
        phases and parts of every project. In architectural school we’re taught
        how to generate design options based on a myriad of factors: basic
        design principles, function, symbolism, nature, context, aesthetics,
        budget, psychology, logic, personal subjectivity, rational objectivity,
        traditional/historical or progressive references, common sense,
        arbitrary notions, fads, etc. As I’ve considered each of these
        rationales through the lens of the gospel’s illuminating truths, I
        believe the spirit has naturally/easily confirmed the valid ideas and/or
        truths and, alternatively, revealed those that are just philosophies of
        man. I want to listen to this spiritual discernment as I generate and
        evaluate design solutions because, among other blessings, this brings
        the exciting and humbling possibility of raising this otherwise temporal
        activity to one with more divine substance… one approaching Joseph’s
        vision of a new paradigm of magnificent buildings and environments.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="bold">
      <span className="bold">The philosophies of man have many marvelous answers, but the question,
        “How can this _____ be designed” can also be considered by applying
        higher levels of analysis, based on divine inspiration and the gospel’s
        eternal truths and values. Further consideration of this concept
        eventually reaches the synonymous, compelling, infamous question,
        “WWJD,” “How/What Would Jesus design.”</span>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        To support these theses, one may examine: A, The Lord’s specific
        directions about buildings in the past; B, How Jesus would not design;
        C, What and how He has designed; and, D, How we might apply the
        principles Jesus taught to design.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="bold">
        A. THE LORD’S DIRECTIONS ABOUT BUILDINGS IN THE PAST{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The Lord’s specific directions about buildings in the past include the
        revelation refining the command to build the Kirtland Temple. Just
        before giving the dimensions of the structure the Lord said, “Now here
        is wisdom, and the mind of the Lord-let the house be built not after the
        manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live after
        the manner of the world; Therefore, let it be built after the manner
        which I shall show unto three of you, whom ye shall appoint and ordain
        unto this power.” <a href="#sources">[14]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        A couple of years later in 1844, there was another applicable incident
        in Nauvoo. Joseph Smith wrote, “Elder William Weeks (whom I had employed
        as architect of the Temple,) came in for instruction, I instructed him
        in relation to the circular windows designed to light the offices in the
        dead work of the arch between stories. (image at right) He said that
        round windows in the broad side of a building were a violation of all
        the known rules of architecture. And contended that they should be
        semicircular-that the building was too low for round windows. I told him
        I would have the circles, if he had to make the Temple ten feet higher
        than originally calculated; that one light at the center of each
        circular window would be sufficient to light the whole room; that when
        the whole building was thus illuminated, the effect would be remarkably
        grand. “I wish you to carry out my designs. I have seen in vision the
        splendid appearance of that building illuminated, and will have it built
        according to the pattern shown me.” <a href="#sources">[15]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The Lord appears to have deemed it enough to work within the 1800′s
        cultural norm/experience, since the Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples are in
        fact, variations of the traditional styles of the day albeit “tweaked”
        in ways as shown above by a prophet with at least a visionary
        appreciation for the untraditional possibilities. One might suppose that
        the saints, who “fly to pieces like glass as soon as anything comes that
        is contrary to their traditions…” <a href="#sources">[16]</a> had plenty of other, more
        important issues and doctrines to get up to speed with than progressive/
        “divine design”. The Tabernacle and its “doubled” successor, the Temple
        of Solomon, (image at right) are also perhaps the definitive examples
        where the Lord was involved in building design. “And let them make me a
        sanctuary… According to all that I shew thee…” <a href="#sources">[17]</a> “See, I have called
        by name Bezaleel… And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in
        wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship, to devise cunning works (“OR artistic designs” per LDS
        bible footnote 4a).” <a href="#sources">[18]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Are not these buildings better for having divine input? Would not any
        building, or any venture for that matter, be better for having divine
        input? I’m not suggesting that Jesus should design our buildings for us
        then reveal them in full. The scriptural passages I started with do not
        suggest that we become non-thinking robots (such was Satan’s plan which
        God rejected at a horrific cost – a third part of his children), but
        rather, agents to our own selves, anxiously engaged in a good cause,
        joyfully choosing to and naturally thinking more and more like God. The
        instances sited above show that God worked through those people and
        their best abilities (their “two talents”) within their cultural,
        technical, and spiritual capacities. That is why some of the early
        saints were sent on “Art Missions” to Europe to study the architecture,
        which, back in Utah, resulted in wonderful buildings exhibiting a
        sometimes odd assortment, but always marvelously zealous smattering, of
        those European styles. They seemed to be guided by Brigham Young’s
        vision that, “Every accomplishment, every polished grace, every useful
        attainment in mathematics, music, in all science and art belong to the
        saints, and they… rapidly collect the intelligence that is bestowed upon
        the nations, for all this intelligence belongs to Zion.” <a href="#sources">[19]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of the many commonly told stories about how the Salt Lake
        Temple was built, the author of a paper in BYU Studies continued, “While
        many of these accounts intend to be faith promoting, hinting that God
        dictated minute details of design and infrastructure, many common
        stories are not factual. Indeed, the stories may detract from the
        appreciation Latter-day Saints should have for the hard labors of mind
        and body the temple builders endured. While those builders were
        inspired, God still expected them to do their home work, to study the
        challenges in their minds, and they did.” <a href="#sources">[20]</a>{" "}

      <p>
        If you are willing to agree that the basic principle of the gospel “to
        become one with God and Christ” has application in physical/temporal
        aspects and, that answers to the question, “how might God design
        _______,” would lead to an infinitely better built environment, then a
        discussion of the following ideas can be considered.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        As a preface to the question, “How would Jesus design something,” one
        might ask how he wouldn’t design.{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="bold">B. HOW HE WOULDN’T DESIGN </p>

      <p>
        As a perfect, all knowing being, the idea that the Lord would choose to
        solve architectural design opportunities with philosophies of men or
        “man’s styles” is illogical. Could He? Yes. Would He? For historic or
        theatrical applications… makes sense. However, otherwise, the thought of
        Jesus designing in the pagan gentile classical style, the later secular
        humanist renaissance, baroque, or gothic style of the spiritually dark
        ages, the minimalist international style, the recent variations of
        modernism or any other impressive worldly sophisticated
        styles/fashions/philosophies of man is like running the latest super
        computer with flint and steel.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Since we know that “whatsoever is good cometh from God”, <a href="#sources">[21]</a> the “good”
        in the various styles of man certainly reveal the hand of God. But just
        as the philosophies of man can be “mingled with scripture”, the inspired
        parts of the world’s styles are limited and “mingled” with their secular
        culture, their technology, etc. Consider the different “levels” of
        inspiration possible as demonstrated in the following “designer’s”
        questions: How should I design this gothic building? How should I design
        this to please my predisposed client (the Pharaoh, the aristocrat, the
        CEO)? How should I design this knowing all the philosophies of man? What
        would be the best way to design this if I was open to all the
        inspiration and knowledge God is willing to send me? The principle of
        free agency limits God to inspire us only to the “level” requested.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Brigham Young valued tradition but explained its mortal constraints.
        “This law (the priesthood) has not always been upon the earth; and in
        its absence, other laws have been given to the children of men for their
        improvement, for their education, for their government, and to prove
        what they would do when left to control themselves; and what we now call
        tradition has grown out of these circumstances.” <a href="#sources">[22]</a> It would follow
        then that since the priesthood is no longer absent, and although many of
        the traditions of man are wonderful, there is something altogether
        greater possible.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Although man’s philosophies, styles and fashions have many fundamental
        and vital lessons and yes, inspired truths to teach and put into the
        cognitive process, God’s ways and vision, including therefore his design
        expertise, are far above mans’ ways.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Honesty and historical respect are additional reasons not to mimic
        traditional styles. The styles of man came about through progression (or
        at least a continuum/evolution) of technology and culture. For example,
        the distinctive Tudor cross timbering came from post and beam wood
        construction and daub and wattle in-fill, the state of the art in
        northern European cultures in the 16th century. When we moderns nail 1 x
        6 boards over modern steel or wood framed houses to evoke the Tudor
        style we are exhibiting a fake, shallow, cartoonish caricature (in an
        individual, this is called being hypocritical). It may also show a level
        of disrespect (however innocently) to the real historical artifacts and
        the people of its’ time.{" "}
      </p><img SRC={one} ALIGN='right' />

      <p>
        The point is evident in the comparison of the Parthenon and the other
        buildings on the Acropolis in Athens to the Caesars Palace Hotel/Casino
        and its neon neighbors in Las Vegas. The Parthenon is considered the
        highest level of classical design. Its mature elements and subtle
        refinements have been the standard for every succeeding generation of
        neo-classicists. Gauged by the patronization of Caesars Palace, the
        latest neo-classical fans are us. Just as the Parthenon was the ancient
        Greek’s temple to their pagan god, is not Caesars Palace our latter-day
        culture’s temple, where one can buy anything in this world with money?
        In its recent renovations and additions, Caesars has been rigorous in
        its adherence to the grand classical style. Yet for all its’ studied
        design, no-one would or should ever consider it anything other than a
        stick-on gimmick, another example of adult Disneylandish thematics,
        slapped up to insipid praise. The comparison and contrast between these
        two works of architecture is profound… as is the less extreme but still
        “fashionable” way we “stick on” traditional, classical or other
        historical elements to our other, more politically correct buildings.
        The Las Vegas Strip is just an exaggeration of every other American
        city’s strip model of development. Consider the ramifications of Edwin
        Hubbell Chapin’s statement regarding fashions/styles, “Fashion is the
        science of appearances, and it inspires one with the desire to seem
        rather than to be.” <a href="#sources">[23]</a>{" "}

      <p>
        As a member of a church that espouses the magnificent principle of
        progression/eternal progression, I’ve considered the progression, or
        journey, of architectural styles through the ages. If we stop
        spiritually progressing, we dam ourselves… we dam up our eternal
        progress. If architectural design stopped at, say, Mesopotamia… put the
        dam on architectural design then, we would never have had Classical,
        Gothic, Victorian or modern styles. Each style evolved from previous
        ones and/or affected subsequent ones. We espouse eternal progression so
        as not to miss the glorious eternal potential. It would logically follow
        that the same wisdom/attitude should excitedly also promote
        architectural progression to not only its’ carnal potential but with
        this paper’s Divine design thesis, its’ ultimate potential.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Disdain for copying historical styles is common among architectural
        professionals and in architectural schools,… yet the attraction for such
        surfacy traditional style is strong in our culture as well as our profit
        driven, opinion poll/fashion dependant developers, venture capitalist
        and consumer “stuff” providers. I always figured most people follow the
        same path I did; growing up loving “Tudor confections” but maturing
        after objectively considering the issues raised above, seeing and
        gaining respect for the real things, seeing the possibilities of
        progressive design and then having this objectivity train our
        subjectivity. I thought more people would similarly “mature”, but have
        wondered why it just isn’t so. Perhaps it is our cultural love of “thin
        things we get caught in the thick of”, or our escapism to nostalgia, or
        we are put off by the artistic elitism that is (or seems) often so
        arcane, perverse or problematic. Or perhaps it is just that substantive
        alternatives are not readily available to us common consumers.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In any case, while progressive design is way down the list of importance
        in the eternal scheme of things, the question still begs a thoughtful
        answer… How would Jesus design?{" "}

      <p>
        A trip I recently took through British Columbia included the heighted
        contrast between the powerful scenic beauty occasionally interrupted by
        man’s “improvements”. In every case, the car scale “strip” retail and
        other traditional developments were earnest, but in most cases, down
        right ugly free market appeals to the passing consumer. While freedom is
        vital and capitalism is powerful and productive, we noticed that the
        situation only intensified as we approached and entered the U.S. “The
        greatest acts of mighty men,” said Joseph Smith, “have been disastrous.
        Before them the earth was a paradise and behind them a desolate
        wilderness… The designs of God, on the other hand, [are that] …the earth
        shall yield its increase, resume its paradisean glory, and become as the
        garden of the Lord.” <a href="#sources">[24]</a>{" "}

        Is not the magnificence of nature the handiwork of God? Are there any

        desert vistas or beautiful ocean shorelines?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        If we want to design like Jesus, we should consider actually, literally,
        designing like Jesus… that is, seriously incorporating or meaningfully
        expressing God’s nature and/or its’ design lessons in our projects.
        (image at right) “After all, Joseph Smith declared, “We are trying to be
        the image of those who live in heaven; we are trying to pattern after
        them, to look like them, to walk and talk like them. To deal like them,
        and build up the kingdom of heaven as they have done.” Yes, but what is
        heaven really like? We know that too, according to Joseph F. Smith; for
        that we have only to look about us: “heaven was the prototype of this
        beautiful creation when it came from the hand of the Creator, and was
        pronounced ‘good.’” ” <a href="#sources">[25]</a> The beauty and balance of nature is
        consistently inspiring as well as instructive, more so than any of man’s
        decorations. For a practical example, I have noticed that room decor,
        along with its’ paintings and photos (even of or by cherished loved ones
        or with personal meaning) become part of a background, rarely
        registering in the mind or, after a time, even looked at. Conversely,
        landscape or plants accessed via windows or atriums rarely fail to
        arouse ones senses. An architect friend once asserted his finding that
        people would respond to a bad building that was filled with plants as
        well or better than to an architecturally significant one.{" "}

        Incorporating nature in projects brings an affinity to the human soul.
        Interestingly, in a project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and
        Office of Building Technology, the Battelle Research Center studied data
        from specific buildings and found significant quantifiable results that
        support the concept of “biophilia,” the innate attraction to and
        preference for nature and natural processes. While citing the data and
        other similar published studies, the report explained “The project is
        testing the hypothesis that “green” buildings can have positive impacts
        on people if they incorporate natural processes and features that are
        analogous to preferred natural habitats. This hypothesis derives from a
        growing body of research, which strongly supports the widely held belief
        that nature is good for us. Until recently, this belief has had little
        scientific basis. However, a host of well-designed and sound studies
        have found that both passive and active interactions with the natural
        world can have profound implications for human health, cognitive
        functioning, psychological well being, and social behaviors.
        Surprisingly, however, the empirical and theoretical work on biophilia
        has had little impact on environmental design. In part this may be due
        to a sense that this isn’t “news.” Everyone knows that nature is
        appealing – that is why designers add flowers and trees to enhance the
        image and curb appeal of their buildings. Yet, many buildings, inside as
        well as outside, are not designed as if biophilia were an important
        design concept. Green amenities, if they exist at all, are often limited
        to high visibility spaces, such as lobbies, and do not extend throughout
        the building. Biophilia, in the sense we are using it in this study, has
        to do not only with the presence of green things in buildings, but also
        with the ways in which space is designed to take advantage of nature and
        natural processes. Biophilic features include viewscapes, daylight,
        sensory retreat, opportunities for active and passive contact with
        nature, sensory change and variability across time and space, and the
        incorporation of nature themes, archetypes, analogs, and materials in
        the designed environment.”<a href="#sources">[26]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Nibley suggests Brigham Young understood this Biophilic principle.
        “Where men cannot foresee the distant effects of their actions on the
        environment because of the vastly complicated interrelationships of the
        balance of nature, what rule of action shall they follow? Brigham was
        never in doubt: the one sure guide for him was the feeling for beauty;
        he knew with Plato that the good, the true, and the beautiful are the
        same; that what looks and feels and sounds and tastes good is to that
        degree sound, useful, and trustworthy: “You watch your own feelings when
        you hear delightful sounds… or when you see anything beautiful. Are
        those feelings productive of misery? No, they produce happiness, peace
        and joy.” We can trust such feelings, for “every flower, shrub, and tree
        to beautify, and to gratify the taste and smell, and every sensation
        that gives to man joy and felicity are for the Saints who receive them
        from the Most High.” <a href="#sources">[27]</a> Our work is “to beautify the whole face of the
        earth, until it shall become like the Garden of Eden.” <a href="#sources">[28]</a> The very
        object of our existence here is to handle the temporal elements of this
        world and subdue the earth, multiplying those organisms of plants and
        animals God has designed shall dwell upon it.” <a href="#sources">[29]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        God’s design talents are evidenced in all sizes: in the Cosmic scale of
        the universe, galaxy and planetary organization; the regional scale in
        eco systems of mountain ranges, oceans, deserts, prairies or jungles;
        the microscopic scale of cell structure, microbial activity to even the
        molecular and atomic scale. God’s designs are as incalculable as they
        are beautiful. The plants and animals are as intriguing and revealing as
        the geologic or material world. These examples provide an infinite
        number of ideas from which to draw design concepts.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        God’s creations, mentioned above, are often considered organic in
        character, but they are also often made up of geometric and mathematic
        truths not so much designed but designed with. Pure forms, including the
        circle, the square, the triangle and their variants, (image at right)
        are not philosophies of man but revelations of truth. When one lets go
        of the relatively few philosophies of man, the innumerable possibilities
        of God’s nature, light and truths become “the new” standard or
        philosophy to work toward and in. “When that which is perfect (God’s
        possibilities) is come, then that which is in part (man’s limited
        philosophies) shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake…
        understood… and thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
        childish things.” <a href="#sources">[30]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Such a vision is not a style or even radical, but an approach or an
        attitude. It is not liberal or conservative. To design like Jesus one
        uses the principles of design (truths of design) with as many of the
        senses (spiritual, intellectual and physical, etc.) turned on as
        possible. The more senses that are turned on, the more relationships
        will be made, and the more concerns will be addressed, etc. John Ruskin,
        the British writer said, “…the art is greatest which conveys… the
        greatest number of the greatest ideas…” <a href="#sources">[31]</a> A thoughtful missionary
        companion related this idea to absolute truths when he spoke of what
        might be termed “absolute design.” “Is there a perfect … say, color,”
        he’d ask. I’d respond, “For what?”. “Exactly,” he suggested. It’s not
        relative. There is a perfect color. One would have to take into account
        the individuals involved as well as perhaps the context, culture,
        lighting, material availability, costs, life-cycle analysis, meaning,
        energy usage’s, waste potential, life safety, etc. It might take
        hundreds of levels of specificity, but there is one color that would be
        the perfect color for a specific application. The possibility that there
        is a best color… or the best design answer… is exciting to consider.
        Mortals are not able to go to that perfect level of analysis on each
        design issue, but we can go further than we do now, and in spiritually
        related categories.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe Jesus would use the principles of design because they are the
        fundamental/basic truths of all design, including design found in
        nature/God’s design. Principles such as:{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Form: proportion, shape, form types, transformations, subtractive and
        additive forms, articulation, positive/negative spaces, etc.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Form and space: multi dimensions, planes, mass,
        verticality/horizontality, closure, light, view, space defining
        elements, etc.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Relationships: interlocking spaces, adjacent spaces, linked spaces, etc.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>Organizations: centralized, linear, radial, clustered, grid, etc.</p>

      <p>
        Principles: scale, axis, symmetry, balance, hierarchy, datum, rhythm,
        repetition, etc. <a href="#sources">[32]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecture has been called “frozen music”. The comparison between
        architecture and music might help those who appreciate and can
        objectively analyze quality music to appreciate the potential of
        architecture. The musical principles/truths of harmony, contrast, meter,
        etc, also have place in great architecture. Just as the recent addition
        of music and advanced cinematography have heightened the endowment
        presentation, so also could more meaningful architecture heighten temple
        and all other activities.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to considering what Jesus wouldn’t design like, what and how
        he has designed and the truths and foundational principles God knows,
        uses and reveals to us, I believe that if we were to try to design like
        Jesus we would also take the principles he taught or exemplified and see
        how they might apply to design. There are many examples:{" "}
      </p>

      <p className="bold">D. GOSPEL PRINCIPLES APPLY TO DESIGN </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">1. MODESTY</span> Jesus showed modesty and
        restraint and asks us also to be frugal and modest. In design,
        ostentatious display of wealth or any other out of proportion element
        seems out of Divine character. Simple, understated designs might be more
        appropriate… crafted works that a humble carpenter might offer, for
        example.{" "}
      </p><img SRC={three} ALIGN='right' />

      <p>
        <span className="bold">2. EXCELLENCE</span> Modesty, however, does not
        denote mediocrity. Jesus is the definition of excellence. Those who want
        to emulate Him would design to the best of their abilities, which, by
        continual faith and works will naturally lead to excellent results. The
        intent is not to do better than others, to get A’s while the majority
        gets the “average – C”, but rather, as Brigham Young said, “What are we
        here for? To learn to enjoy more, and to increase in knowledge and in
        experience.” <a href="#sources">[33]</a> Nibley summarizes, “Learning is our proper calling…
        First and last, the gospel is learning unlimited.” <a href="#sources">[34]</a> The great
        British architect, Sir Norman Foster, told me once, “What you’re
        interested in will show in your work.” The work by designers interested
        in continually learning the unlimited gospel will show ever-increasing
        excellence. Continual progress then would enable people to comprehend,
        incorporate and embrace more and more issues. Conversely, when the built
        environment exhibits the average or carnal interests so loved by the
        world, an opportunity for true (Godly) excellence is missed.{" "}
      </p><img SRC={four} ALIGN='right' />

      <p>
        <span className="bold">3. MEANING </span> As Jesus is also the master of
        power and powerful messages, designs can also be powerful and meaningful
        in an infinite number of ways. There are many projects designed around
        the idea of the continuation of eternity. For example, an architect
        recently designed a home for a client that expressed the progress of
        life from childhood to “grandparenthood.” (photos at right) Walls
        stepped up and around/creating an entry courtyard, and then continued
        through the house to form the rear yard, ending at the client’s parent’s
        apartment door. The meaning was incorporated with the functional
        requirements of the building and site. Architecture can powerfully
        integrate meaning with everyday circulation. In effect, one can
        literally live (or work, play, worship, etc.) in art, surrounded by
        helpful meaning.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Meaning in architecture, just as in Jesus’ parables and teachings, can
        be simple or multi-layered. Such meaning and expression can be a strong
        organizational “parti” or an overlaid series of other higher prioritized
        factors. An article in the April 97 Ensign described the experience of
        an architecture student who was required to include in his masters
        thesis a design of a building that would demonstrate a word or phrase to
        describe the spirit of his church. Several suggestions were considered
        and the student eventually received, as an answer to prayer, the words
        “Light” and “Enlightenment”… from which he designed a building that
        integrated these ideas into the design. <a href="#sources">[35]</a>
      </p><img SRC={five} ALIGN='right' />

      <p>
        As another example of letting important meaning be the basis for design,
        in 1991, an architectural design was submitted (and subsequently
        appeared in the exhibition) to the Church’s 2nd International Art
        Competition/Exhibition, “Themes from the Scriptures”. (photo at right)
        The hypothetical design was for a temple using the same size and
        quantity of elements then required for temples. True to the requirements
        of the exhibition, the design was derived from the scripture in Isaiah,
        “In the last days… the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established
        in the tops of the mountains… and He will teach us of his ways and we
        will walk in His paths… let us walk in the light of the Lord.” <a href="#sources">[36]</a> The
        design was derived from, contained layers of meaning of and expressive
        of images of “mountains”, “the path” (the path/plan of salvation) and
        “light”. As a purely personal and joyful hypothetical continuing
        exercise, as the architect participated in his regular personal temple
        worship over the subsequent years, answers regularly came to the
        questions of “how could “this” element (of the temple design) be more
        meaningful, more efficient, more responsive, etc..” This has naturally
        resulted in additional design variants.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after the initial exhibition, the same architect was encouraged
        by the head of design in the Church‘s Physical Facilities Department to
        show what meaning could be incorporated into the Church’s standard
        “Legacy” plan without increasing the cost or changing the footprint. The
        resulting design had elements such as the seating, the circulation, the
        building massing, entries, and even a tall pointed steeple of a skylight
        all giving simple reverence to the sacrament, the primary purpose of the
        building in the first place.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecture and planning certainly does not have to be religious in
        function to be incorporated with or derived from a substantive meaning.
        Many homes, schools, offices, retail, airports, municipal buildings and
        others abound with a meaningful conceptual base.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">4. HONESTY </span> Honesty in design can be
        manifest in architecture in several ways. As mentioned previously, just
        as Jesus asks us to be honest in all our dealings, we can create
        elements made out of things they appear to be made out of. The textures
        and feel of a real material can add to the design intent. Masonry
        connotes solidity and strength. Glass can bring light, airiness and
        openness. Wood can bring warmth and nature. Similarly, there is an
        honesty in using materials in natural ways. The great architect, Louis
        Kahn is famous for teaching this idea by asking the brick “what it wants
        to do.” As a material with its only significant strength in compression,
        it “wants to” span openings as an arch (in contrast to bearing on a
        steel beam). Therefore, the example concludes, the most honest, natural
        way to create openings in masonry is with arches.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        An honest building is one whose outside relates to the inside (and
        visa-versa). Except when deception/surprise is the intent, it is
        extremely disappointing to come upon buildings whose exteriors strongly
        suggest a certain kind of interior, only to find something altogether
        different, unrelated or unsympathetic to its exterior. An example of
        this is a bank building seen recently in Arizona with a striking,
        faceted copper domed roof, which, upon inspection of its interior, had a
        ubiquitous 10′ high, 2′x 4′ suspended acoustical tile ceiling. Such
        works remind one that, “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways”
        <a href="#sources">[37]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">5. DEBT </span> In an unscientific survey I just
        conducted, asking people about the costs of housing and utilities, I
        found the following: For a household with a $50,000 gross income, the
        take-home income after taxes, social security, and health insurance
        comes to $36,000. A house mortgage of $120,000 at 8.25% interest rate
        results in monthly payments of $1100. Add on $200 per month in utilities
        (power, gas, water, sewer, etc.) results in $1,300 per month. This
        amounts to 43% of a family’s take home pay that goes to the house. If
        tithing is paid, the percentage goes to 50%. Over 30 years, the amount
        paid for the house is $468,000. This doesn’t take into account other
        “stuff” to furnish and equip the house.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        How did we get into this predicament? It is quite different than former
        times when homes were hewn from the wilderness. Our American society has
        evolved to accept this as a cultural norm. But that is all it is – a
        cultural norm. People throughout the world live long happy lives with
        substantially less costly housing. Yes, that family cited above can buy
        a less expensive home in the first place, but what if there were ways to
        have as comfortable and functional a house for say, half as much? Think
        of the money that could instead be put in savings every month…, or the
        time spent, instead of working to afford the mortgage, playing with and
        teaching the kids.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        What if there was a system where instead of the monthly payments going
        to a mortgage company, the monthly money would go to “pay as you go”
        increases in the size and/or quality of the home, incrementally as
        family changes warrant? Over the life of a mortgage, as demonstrated
        above, about 3 times the price of a house, in this case $348,000 could
        be saved. Could Jesus figure out a way to make the above (or better)
        scenarios work? Could we, with his inspiration, figure out a way to make
        the above (or better) scenarios work?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">6. EFFICIENCY/ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP </span>{" "}
        Efficiency in design is likened to the efficiency evident in Godly
        organizations, nature and Jesus’ ability to say a lot in a small
        parable. The Latter-day pioneers, led by the always thrifty Brigham
        Young, were famous for their work ethic that made survival in the harsh
        frontier possible and eventually blossom. Theirs was the motto, “Use
        [fix] it up, wear it out, make it do or do without.” The twentieth
        century has brought a life style with increasing conveniences and
        advances unknown of in recorded history. In the latter portion of this
        century we have had a “deck chair shuffling on the Titanic mentality”
        that disregards the natural consequences of our actions… aided and
        abetted by our engineering/problem solving prowess, and the attitude
        that energy would be “too cheap to meter”. We in the industrialized
        nations have an economic system based on consumption, which has created
        an extraordinarily comfortable lifestyle for the past several decades.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        We in the Baby Boom era of the Church have bought into the mindset and
        exhibit the same symptoms of “affluenza” as our gentile brothers. This
        love of “stuff” has consequences. God wants us to “handle the gold and
        silver of the whole earth without having a desire for it. Only as a
        means with which to gather Israel, redeem Zion, subdue and beautify the
        earth, and bring all things in readiness to live with God in heaven.”
        <a href="#sources">[38]</a> “As long as we go on accumulating stuff in this life, we are
        playing the devil’s game.” <a href="#sources">[39]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the words of Joseph Smith to the saints in Far West, (and
        compare them to today’s society) “Brethren, we are gathering to this
        beautiful land, to build up “Zion.” …But since I have been here I
        perceive the spirit of selfishness. Covetousness exists in the hearts of
        the Saints. …Here are those who begin to spread out buying up all the
        land they are able to… Now I want to tell you, that Zion cannot be built
        up in any such way… I see signs put out, Beer signs, speculative schemes
        are being introduced. This is the way of the world- Babylon indeed…”
        <a href="#sources">[40]</a> Nibley points out that Joseph changed the “up and coming name of
        “Commerce” to “Nauvoo, the beautiful”, showing something of where he
        thought a city and its peoples priorities could be. <a href="#sources">[41]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the effect of material consumption in the U.S. alone if we
        continue to consume at our current rate of an estimated 40 – 50 times as
        much as an average person in the third world. The U.S. population, 5
        percent of the world total, uses about 30 percent of the energy.<a href="#sources">[42]</a>
        Then consider also the words of Brigham Young, “It is not our privilege
        to waste the Lord’s substance.” <a href="#sources">[43]</a> Why? For one parochial reason as
        pointed out so interestingly in the book, “Working Toward Zion” by James
        W. Lucas and Warner P. Woodworth, in a few short decades, if church
        growth rates continue, a mere 10% of the members of the church will be
        in North America and Europe. 90% of the membership of the church will
        live in a third world condition.<a href="#sources">[44]</a> These people are our brothers and
        sisters, entitled to as much of our love and concern, and action (or
        more conscientious, efficient action) as one from across the street or
        across a couple of state (or stake) lines.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In a leadership meeting I attended featuring Elder Boyd K. Packer, a
        fellow asked about the “needs” of his special interest group. Elder
        Packer took sharp exception to such “needs” and was humblingly pointed
        in explaining that as he has ministered in less fortunate places around
        the world he has visited with people who were truly needy…, people who
        had little or nothing…, people whose only hope came from their humble,
        guileless faith. “It is not given that one man should posses that which
        is above another, wherefore the world lieth in sin.” <a href="#sources">[45]</a> If we in
        latter-day America (it having fulfilled it’s primary purpose of
        providing an environment for the restoration, nurturing and raising of
        the church to world wide stature) haven’t been “spanked” for our
        diversions to our Divine mandates, to a degree we are rendered totally
        superfluous to the gospel’s mission, the very least we owe our third
        world brothers and sisters is more efficient, responsible consumption of
        the earth’s resources.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if we have substantive doubts about the assertions and the remedies
        of those who warn of man-made global environmental degradations,
        shouldn’t we be “conservative” in our approach? Nibley pointed out, “It
        behooves us as fortunate visitors in the King’s palace to behave
        circumspectly (conservatively), to look and admire, damage nothing, take
        nothing with us, and leave everything as nearly as possible as we found
        it. Restraint is the watchword in dealing with God’s earth.” <a href="#sources">[46]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        What does this have to do with architecture and the built environment?{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the principles of modern architecture was maximizing the
        efficiency of spaces. Wasted space caused by poor or average design also
        causes wasted materials, wasted opportunity, and wasted energy to
        condition the space, plus wasted effort that went into creating the
        wasted space, materials, opportunity and energy in the first place.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        This applies to land use as well as buildings. Suburbia, the great
        American planning experiment has given a century of people a way of
        life. Those of us happily raised in suburbia, sometimes find it hard to
        recognize that in addition to its benefits, suburban land planning is
        not “perfection” and may have serious negative consequences. Based on
        the automotive revolution, this car based planning mode has contributed
        to the disintegration (some say, destruction) of real, people to people
        neighborhoods and place making. Modern suburbia uses huge tracts of
        land, sometimes the most productive, at huge material amounts per
        capita. (photo at right) Suburbia seems to be self perpetuating as these
        unnourishing neighborhoods age and “de-volve” and people (including most
        people in the north American Mormon culture) flee ever outward to newer
        incarnations of our societies developers latest “pot-shelf progress”.
        This of course causes the need for more cars to get around the sprawl on
        larger and more freeways, which continues the vicious circle of
        discontent, urban flight and disintegration.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        An alternative that Jesus might validate as being based more on people
        than on cars is “traditional town planning/new urbanism.” (image at
        right) This model, traditional in that it is derived from a pedestrian,
        pre automotive based type of town planning, is experiencing a
        renaissance as people are recognizing the negative side of
        suburbanization and are looking for something more humane. In addition
        to the higher density, other issues of “new urbanism” include enhanced
        sidewalks and narrower streets, which would result in the resource
        efficient lay out of utilities, for example. These projects attempt to
        be more pedestrian oriented. Front porches would be an important feature
        that would overlook the streetscape and provide opportunities for people
        to embrace the neighborhood. The usual situation of garage doors
        creating the street edges would be diminished. There would be an
        increased emphasis on community parks and other community amenities. But
        an important point to make, one of the weaknesses of the new urbanist
        developments, thus far, is that the architecture has reverted to a
        hollow selection of traditional, “stick-on elements.” A better result,
        more rigorously and consistently substantive could be obtained if the
        developers also embraced the other worthy issues of energy utilization,
        the environment, and of course the spiritual framework here proposed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another alternative to suburbia is a more dramatic break. The architect
        Paolo Soleri still stands by the vision he first proposed a quarter
        century ago, manifest by “Arcosanti” outside Phoenix, Arizona. During
        the first Iraq war Soleri said, “Now we are again in the middle of a
        storm because of the environmental crisis. But today no one mentions
        that our energy problems are largely caused by suburban sprawl. No
        matter how well we do the wrong things, we aren’t going to solve the
        problem. We’ll simply cushion it.” <a href="#sources">[47]</a> His solution is to build
        fantastic mega-structures, which combine residential, occupational,
        agricultural and other societal functions in a building or closely
        interconnected buildings. Utility systems, power, water waste, etc.,
        would be generated, recycled and/or otherwise managed in a closed loop,
        on site, in ways benign to the environment. To those who recoil at the
        image of inhabiting such large buildings Soleri counters, “To turn to
        the issue of mega-structures: You know, I intend to build something that
        is physically a “mini,” not a “mega.” The city of Phoenix is truly a
        mega-structure; I suggest that something as sprawling as Phoenix could
        instead be made of mini-structures. If they happen to be more visible in
        the landscape because they’re tall and stratified, that doesn’t change
        the fact that they occupy only a fraction of the volume or consume a
        fraction of the energy used in Phoenix.” <a href="#sources">[48]</a> Cities and buildings can
        and should be designed to minimize the energy required to service them.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Designing any building to minimize energy usage is very easily done.
        Many of the strategies cost nothing. For example, minimizing the east
        and west exposures while maximizing the north and south will decrease
        solar gain in the summer and increase solar gain in the winter (since in
        winter the sun is lower in the southern sky). Appropriate window size
        and placement, thermal mass, insulation, natural ventilation, earth
        integration, etc., will all yield dramatic energy savings at minimal, if
        any, additional capital cost. Strategies which will soon pay for their
        higher initial costs include installing higher performance glazing,
        solar hot water heating systems, day-lighting and various assortments of
        electronic sensors and equipment, to name just a few. These strategies
        should be basic to anyone involved in building that has a sincere desire
        to be efficient.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Energy sources created through renewable resources; solar, wind, hydro,
        etc., hold great promise of efficiency, independence, reliability and
        cleanliness. All these admirable attributes are found in Jesus and his
        thoughtful followers. The renewable energy sources are therefore worth
        consideration and application.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Buildings and communities can utilize these resources for all or part of
        their energy needs. For example, there are many buildings powered and
        heated entirely, or in large part, by the sun through photovoltaic
        systems and passive and active solar strategies. $0 monthly utility
        bills are certainly “of good report or praiseworthy.” Remarkable recent
        advances have been made in these technologies reducing the costs
        significantly.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The criticism of renewables has always been their higher cost compared
        to the cost of connecting on the utility grid and our nonrenewable
        energy consuming culture. While this is still the case in most
        instances, remote locations (sometimes only a couple hundred yards from
        a grid connection and its fee by the foot) can make the cost of
        renewable sources like PV less expensive in capital than the grid today
        as well as in long term life cycle costs.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">7. “ETERNALITY”/SUSTAINABILITY </span>God always
        has an eternal perspective. Jesus would design in such a way that
        resulting projects would not adversely affect future generations. This
        approach has been termed “sustainable development”. Since energy
        efficiency issues described previously affect the earth’s resources,
        pollution and cultural norms, it is certainly a primary concern to
        sustainable design. Another concern is the cradle to cradle
        characteristics of building materials. It is estimated that up to one
        third of the waste that goes into landfills is construction waste.
        Instead of thinking about the creation, use and eventual discarding of
        things, we should close the loop. Instead of discarding a worn out
        element, we can recycle the matter in the element to a new use… and
        start the cycle again. Brigham Young said, “Never let anything go to
        waste. Be prudent, save everything.” <a href="#sources">[49]</a> Even sewage has its uses:
        “Everything, also, which will fertilize our gardens and our fields
        should be sedulously saved and wisely husbanded, that nothing may be
        lost which contains the elements of food and raiment for man and
        sustenance for beast.” <a href="#sources">[50]</a> Obsolescence would be mitigated and planned
        obsolescence would be exposed as the evil fraud it is. Another aspect to
        consider in the measure of a material’s sustainability is its embodied
        energy, that is, the sum total energy it takes to create, transport and
        place a material in a building. For example, a steel column, with the
        energy required to mine, transport the raw materials, smelt, refine and
        form the steel, then transport and assemble, would have higher embodied
        energy than say, a wood post.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the enormous amount of unnecessary waste of building
        material, construction waste also comes from demolition of relatively
        short lived modern buildings created by our short term thinking culture.
        If longer life building design, materials and systems cannot be
        financially justified through longer perspective minded life cycle
        analysis, then at least building design, materials and systems that have
        benign waste potential can be used. Ideally both strategies could be
        employed.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Ancient systems such as adobe, rammed earth and earth integration can
        last a long time (consider the 300 year old Taos Pueblo), and when they
        do eventually disintegrate back to dust, no toxic substances remain.
        (photo at right) More people live in adobe houses than in all other
        building systems combined. In the United States alone, more than 500,000
        live in adobe houses. Throughout history, “earth” has been the world’s
        most widely used construction material. “The use of mud in new
        construction has undergone a revolution lately. It has been used for
        everything from low-income HUD housing to multimillion-dollar mansions.
        In an energy-conscious age, it has become the ideal material for a
        passive solar house.” <a href="#sources">[51]</a>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many exciting ways to make buildings more sustainable. Many
        require only common sense; others come from the Divine gift of
        innovation.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">8. INNOVATION </span> Innovation is considering
        all options, concerns and materials and synergistically creating
        solutions greater than the sum of the parts. Synergy is a Christian
        concept exemplified by hope, faith and works magnified through the
        divine grace and merits of Him who is mighty to save. We do not have all
        knowledge as God has, but He has shared with us the opportunity to
        experience the thought process that goes into creating. Design in
        architecture is the mental (and hopefully spiritual) activity of taking
        the factors and creating solutions…, “spiritually” first, in preparation
        to then being physically constructed. Innovation in architecture is
        going a step or two beyond, out into the darkness, addressing a couple
        more issues and solving them all with a new or “higher” perspective. It
        is looking at the question of how to design a house (or an office or
        factory, etc.) afresh, free from preconceptions, as if a house has never
        been seen before. Not “reinventing the wheel”, but the paradigm shift of
        “creating a better mousetrap.”{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        An innovative architect, William Bruder, took note that the client was
        an ironworker. Using the owner’s spare pipe and abilities, he designed a
        home that celebrated the roof structure as an expressive space frame,
        fabricated at a weekend building party at virtually only the cost of the
        refreshments. (image at right){" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        An other architect, the author, recognized that indoor planted areas are
        a desirable amenity, then designed a building, not with studs or bricks
        or even adobe, but with no walls at all… just earth berms pushed up when
        the site is graded. (image at right) Appearing to be an expensive
        feature, the colorful, fragrant plant covered berms also save on the
        cost of the building and will save in energy usage because of its
        thermal advantages.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Architectural innovation is possible with thoughtful uses of off the
        shelf items, regular items used in different ways or new items used in
        productive ways. The continually advancing sciences and technologies are
        suppliers of and resources for life enhancing, innovative design. The
        path of creative, lateral thinking is following the example of Joseph
        Smith in keeping the mind gregariously open to truth and expecting the
        infinite/innovative possibilities to be revealed as the search goes on.{" "}
      </p><img SRC={six} ALIGN='right' />

      <p>
        <span className="bold">9. THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE </span> Above all other
        principles that we can apply to design is Heavenly Father’s ultimate
        objective, “To bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”
        Every design decision can be judged against this over-arching goal. Our
        built environment should enhance and respect a people’s context and
        especially, the individual. We could have buildings (and cities) that
        nurture, that reinforce learning and growth, that can adjust as we age,
        and that can change seasonally, or even from moment to moment, as might
        be appropriate to the spirit.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="bold">CONCLUSION</span>{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The images of architecture and other habitats designed by Jesus, and
        more applicably, by people striving to design how Jesus might, are
        exciting to imagine. Joseph Smith saw them in vision and was thrilled.
        Perhaps the cities and buildings would seem like they are extensions of
        nature…. like they grew there or belong there. (images at right) One
        could imagine building elements and streets laid out in ways to perhaps
        emphasize important ideas or spaces and de-emphasize un-substantive
        ideas or items. Many elements like entries or people spaces would be
        designed in conjunction with nature and geometry in powerful and
        functional ways. Such developments would be efficient so as to need only
        the energy created (without polluting by-products) on site with
        innovative technologies, made cost effective through the incorporation
        of natural heating and cooling strategies. Materials used would be
        cost-effective, often natural and finished in natural ways… ways that
        never give (or gave) toxic side effects. Developments would support
        local contexts and local resources in ways that honor, embrace and add
        to the local culture and economy, making opportunities for a high
        quality of life affordable and attainable worldwide. All the while, such
        projects could be meaningful in timeless ways, not the least of which
        would be an overall reflection of our God and his love and invitation to
        come to Him and adopt His ways.{" "}
      </p><img SRC={seven} ALIGN='right' />

      <p>
        Although the philosophies of man have answers, the question, “how should
        this ______be designed”, will be far more substantively answered by
        aspiring to design as Jesus would …open to all the inspiration
        available. Mormons often realize that the real solutions to the
        challenges faced by the world are found in the gospel. Is it not obvious
        that the same is true of our built environment? Such developments are
        not just millennial evolutions but include strategies, design ideas,
        technologies and opportunities that are available now, only requiring
        interested patrons to choose them instead of the customary philosophies
        of man. The real potential of “a peculiar peoples” architecture and
        built environment is a continuation of the “blossoming”, approaching
        greater, even divine heights.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us be like the Brother of Jared. When challenged by the Lord to come
        up with a solution to one of his habitat dilemmas, he didn’t just offer
        the common rock at his feet. Rather, after an exemplary (albeit
        unrecorded) inspired and thought filled design process, he went to the
        mountain and crafted “white and clear stones, even as transparent glass”
        – the most elegant proposal he could create, one he humbly hoped would
        be embraced by God.
